# Hey! I'm David!
### Iâ€™m interested in C# and Unity Game Development
## My Current Projects:
### - Flappy Disk
 A Flappy Bird-esque android game.
 Also my first (finished) mobile game.
### - Fragmented
 A side project that turned into a main project through the power of hyperfixation!
 A short 3D game available on my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/dgc).
### - Amplitude
  My current project!
  Amplitude will be a 2D multiplayer card game about science-_y_ stuff!
### - Going Home
 A scrapped project..
 It would've been simple 2D platformer with a developing story!
### You can reach me on discord, **@Pankake#1769**, or through **[my website's Contact Us Page](https://davidgameco.com/contact-us)**

## My Archive
### All games in the Archive are available [here](https://davidgameco.com/archives)
### - A Troublesome Tale *(Scrapped)*
This was my first project!
ATT was a short FPS based on a Unity Tutorial
### - The Interview *(Semi-compete, abandoned)*
The Interview was a.. I have no clue how to describe it.
Just play it, it's short.
### - The Explorer _(Complete)_
The Explorer was a platformer based on a Unity Tutorial.
It's.. quite mediocre.
