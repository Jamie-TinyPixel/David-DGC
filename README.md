# Hey! I'm David!
### I’m interested in C# and Unity Game Development
## My Current Projects:
### - Flappy Disk
 A Flappy Bird-esque android game.
 Also my first (finished) mobile game.
### - Going Home
 My current project!
 A simple 2D platformer with a developing story!
### - Fragmented
 A side project that turned into a main project through the power of hyperfixation!
 A short 3D game available on my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/dgc).
### You can reach me on discord, **@Pankake#1769**, or through **[my website's Contact Us Page](https://davidgameco.com/contact-us)**
